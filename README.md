# mod2ptm
A tool that converts ProTracker MODs to Poly Tracker PTMs. I originally wrote this a day ago, and refined it today (8/15/2022).

Fully format compatible.

Usage: mod2ptm.py module.mod module.ptm

There is also a tool that does the exact same thing besides converting command C (set volume) to a volume command.
